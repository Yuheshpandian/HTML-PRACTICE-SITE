## How I learned HTML
In reality to learn any programming language, even HTML requires a lot of attention, confidence and patience to learn everything about html. No one can become a pro at the instance, but it takes lot of practice and hard work. I learned HTML in a fun way and tried to understand everything I could. Maybe you would have your own programmer way ^_~ .
